# Polymorphism in C-Sharp
My experiments with Polymorphism in C#

## WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT?
- Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
- We can implement polymorphism in two ways: 
-- Static or Compile time Polymorphism implemented by function and operator overloading
-- Runtime or Dynamic Polymorphism by virtual methods

In this tutorial we are going to see Dynamic or Runtime Polymorphism.
