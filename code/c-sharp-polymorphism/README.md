# Polymorphism in C-Sharp
My experiments with Polymorphism in C#

## WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT?
- Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
- We can implement polymorphism in two ways: 
  - Static or Compile time Polymorphism implemented by function and operator overloading
  - Runtime or Dynamic Polymorphism by virtual methods
- Polymorphism is the use of virtual methods to make one method (name) produce one of the many possible outcomes (behaviours) depending upon the instance.
- Polymorphism allows base classes to reach its decedents.

In this tutorial we are going to see Dynamic or Runtime Polymorphism.
