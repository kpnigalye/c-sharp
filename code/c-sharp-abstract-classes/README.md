# WHAT IS AN ABSTRACT CLASS AND WHY TO USE IT?
- By convention, an abstract class must be defined with a keyword called ‘abstract’.
- You cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
- You can use Abstract Class instead of an Interface if you want to force some behaviour on Derived Classes and it also lets you define implementation of functions if you want.
- Virtual or Abstract method cannot be defined as Private.

# Note
### Abstract Classes and Derived Classes are implemented in the same file for better understanding.
### Please find attached a PDF of my stepwise observations while making use of abstract classes.
